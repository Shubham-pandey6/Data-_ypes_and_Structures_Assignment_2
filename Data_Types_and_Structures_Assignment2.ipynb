        "## **Theoretical Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What are data structures, and why are they important?**  \n",
        "   Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, and storing data. They are important because they allow efficient data access, modification, and management, enabling better algorithm performance and resource optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.**  \n",
        "   - **Mutable** data types can be changed after creation (e.g., lists: `my_list = [1,` → `my_list.append(3)`).\n",
        "   - **Immutable** data types cannot be altered once created (e.g., strings: `s = \"hello\"` → cannot change `s`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?**  \n",
        "   - Lists are **mutable**, tuples are **immutable**.\n",
        "   - Lists consume more memory and are **slower** to access than tuples.\n",
        "   - Tuples are **used for fixed collections**, like coordinates or database records.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Describe how dictionaries store data.**  \n",
        "   Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs using a **hash table**. Keys are hashed, and their corresponding values are stored in an array-like structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?**  \n",
        "   Sets eliminate duplicate entries and provide **faster lookup** for membership testing (using hashing), unlike lists which allow duplicates and have **linear time lookups**.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?**  \n",
        "   A string is a sequence of characters, **immutable**, and typically used for text. A list is a **mutable** sequence that can store elements of any data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?**  \n",
        "   Their **immutability** ensures values can't be changed after creation, making them suitable for fixed associations (e.g., database records, function return values).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**  \n",
        "   A hash table maps keys to values using a hash function. Python’s **dictionary** is an implementation of a hash table.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Can lists contain different data types in Python?**  \n",
        "   Yes, Python lists are heterogeneous. Example: `[1, \"apple\", 3.14, True]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Explain why strings are immutable in Python.**  \n",
        "    Strings are immutable to ensure **hash consistency**, **thread safety**, and **performance optimization** (e.g., string interning and reuse).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?**  \n",
        "    - **Faster lookups** by key (O(1) on average).\n",
        "    - **Clearer data associations** using key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.**  \n",
        "    When storing **fixed data** like coordinates `(x, y)`, dates, or as **keys in dictionaries**, since tuples are hashable.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**  \n",
        "    Sets automatically **eliminate duplicates**, storing each unique element only once.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?**  \n",
        "    - In **lists**, it checks for the **presence of a value** (linear search).\n",
        "    - In **dictionaries**, it checks for the **presence of a key** (constant time by hashing).\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.**  \n",
        "    No. Tuples are **immutable**, meaning once created their content cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.**  \n",
        "    A dictionary containing another dictionary as a value.  \n",
        "    Example:  \n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    student = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"grades\": {\"math\": 90, \"science\": 85}}\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.**  \n",
        "    Average-case time complexity is **O(1)** due to the underlying hash table implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?**  \n",
        "    - When **order matters**.\n",
        "    - When storing **a simple collection** of elements without key-value relationships.\n",
        "    - For **indexed data** (e.g., a sequence of numbers or strings).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**  \n",
        "    Traditionally, dictionaries didn't maintain insertion order. While Python 3.7+ maintains order, it's still advisable not to rely on it for critical tasks. Regardless, lookups remain **key-based**, not position-based.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**  \n",
        "    - Lists retrieve values by **index** (e.g., `mylist`).\n",
        "    - Dictionaries retrieve values by **key** (e.g., `mydict[\"name\"]`).\n",
